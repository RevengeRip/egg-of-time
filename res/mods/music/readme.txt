Egg of Time - music mods
========================

Put an audio file in this folder to replace one of the game's music tracks. Name it
after the track it replaces, with the file's own extension:

    BGM_18.ogg      replaces "Chrono Trigger"
    BGM_45.flac     replaces "Battle"

A track without a file here plays as usual.

Tracks
------
Titles and numbers are the game's own, from Extras > Music Box. The game does not
list the tracks marked "not in the Music Box"; to find where one plays, run the game
from a terminal: its log names every music track as it starts ("music: BGM_xx").

Formats
-------
1. Any common audio file: .ogg (Vorbis), .opus, .flac, .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .aac.
   Any sample rate, mono or stereo (more channels are mixed down to stereo).
   Looping: the track loops from the LOOPSTART tag to the LOOPEND tag, or to
   LOOPSTART + LOOPLENGTH, all counted in samples (the tags vgmstream rips and
   RPG Maker use). Without these tags the whole file loops.

2. MSU-1 PCM (.pcm), the SNES MSU-1 format: "MSU1", a 4-byte loop point
   (samples, little-endian), then 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo little-endian samples.
   It plays to its end, then continues from the loop point.

If there are several files for one track, the first in the order above is used
(.ogg, .opus, .flac, .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .aac, .pcm).

Playing
-------
- Replacements play while System Settings > Mods is On (the default).
- The game's fades and volume changes apply to them. A jingle (fanfare) stops when
  the game's own jingle would have ended.
- Leave some headroom: a file mastered at full loudness will sound louder than the
  game's sound effects.
- After loading a save state, a replaced track starts again from its beginning.
